If it is relevant, then both precision and recall increase, and the curve jags up and to the right.\n",

The traditional way of doing this is the *11-point interpolated average*. For each information need, the interpolated precision is measured at the 11 recall levels of 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 1.0. Then we average interpolated precision over all queries in the test collection and plot, like here:\n",
